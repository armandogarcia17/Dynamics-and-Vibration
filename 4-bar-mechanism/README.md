# DEMO 4-bar Mechanism Kinematics and Dynamics

In this demo we explore the classic **4-bar Mechanism**.  We look at it's 
kinematics and dynamics.

See the WORKFLOW section for the CENTRAL way of launching this content.

What Benefit does MATLAB Bring to the Learning experience ?

1.  INSIGHTS through visualization.  A great example of this is the 
"bh_4bar_explore_app.mlapp".  Another is framing a repetative task such as
solving for the motion locus of the mechanism ... into a COMPUTATIONAL 
THINKING solution.

2.  EXPLORE and DISCOVER - Don't use MATLAB to solve just 1 problem.  Instead
solve MANY(often repatitive problems).  Eliminate the Fear of "Computational 
complexity" ... *IFFF* you know the CONCEPTUAL steps, then use MATLAB to implement
them - a great example is the Lagrangian derivation.  It would be a shame if
a student "raised the white flag" because they though that the only way of
exploring this was to spend an hour of doing error prone derivations.  The derivation
can still be done using their BRAIN combined with MATLAB's(Symbolic) BRAWN. 

3.  SIMULATE - Don't just "marvel" at the pretty equations .... use them !  
Eg: How does the machine respond when excited by a particular torque.

**Product dependencies:**
1. MATLAB
2. SIMULINK
3. Symbolic Math Toolbox
4. Simscape
5. Simscape MultiBody

## Contents

There's alot.  Use the Content Launching APP to naviagte to a demo of 
interest, ie:

**To get started:**
* \>> bh_4bar_startup

Then start exploring the 5 demos on the START_HERE tab.


## Concepts

Some key concepts that are demonstrated include:

1. Symbolic computing can support and enhance the 1st principles
    derivation of the system equations of motion.

2. Simulate dynamic systems with Simulink

## Suggested Audience

CSEs, udergraduate students, professors, mechanical engineering

## Time

N/A

## Workflow

1.   \>> bh_4bar_startup
* this launches the DEMO content launching APP.

2. Goto the SYSTEM_CHECK tab and click the BLUE button to confirm ALL of 
the products dependencies have been installed

3. Goto the START_HERE tab and look/explore at the 5 listed demos.
