# DEMO Wheel on a Pole

In this demo we model the WHEEL suspended on a POLE system - a "classic" 
case study introduced in both Engineering and Physics courses on Rigid 
Body Dynamics.

DEMO features worth noting:

1. A content Launcher APP for easy navigation to the various models

## Owner/s

Bradley Horton (bhorton@mathworks.com)

## Contents

There's alot.  Use the Content Launching APP to naviagte to a demo of 
interest, ie:

**To get Started:**
* \>> bh_wheel_on_pole_startup

## Concepts

After launching the content launching APP, You can then choose to explore 
either a STANDARD Euler formulation or a 
MODIFIED EULER formulation.  For both Scenarios, the system equations of 
motion are defined and then implemented in both Simulink and Simscape 
Multibody.  The Simulink results are compared against teh Simscape results.

## Suggested Audience

CSEs, udergraduate students, professors, mechanical engineering

## Time

N/A

## Workflow

* \>> bh_wheel_on_pole_startup

And interact with teh content launching APP.
